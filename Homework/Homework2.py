# Part 2: Coding Exercises
# Solve the following exercises by writing the correct code beneath each comment.

# Exercise 1: Arithmetic Operations
# Given two numbers, x and y, calculate the following:
x = 10
y = 4

# 1. Determine the sum of x and y and print it.

# 2. Determine the difference between x and y and print it.

# 3. Determine the product of x and y and print it.

# 4. Determine the floor division result of y divided by x.


# Exercise 2: Comparison Operations
# Given two numbers, a and b, use comparison operators to check the following:
a = 8
b = 15

# 1. Is a greater than b? Print the result (True or False).

# 2. Is a equal to b? Print the result (True or False).

# 3. Is b greater than or equal to a? Print the result (True or False).


# Exercise 3: Logical Operations
# Given two conditions, is_raining and is_windy, determine the following using logical operators:
is_raining = True
is_windy = False

# 1. Should we stay inside if it is both raining and windy? (Use AND operator)

# 2. Can we go for a walk if it is either raining or windy? (Use OR operator)

# 3. Is it not raining? (Use NOT operator)


# Exercise 4: Assignment Operators
# Given a variable `c`, use assignment operators to perform the following operations:
c = 5

# 1. Add 10 to `c` using an assignment operator and print the new value of `c`.

# 2. Subtract 3 from `c` using an assignment operator and print the new value of `c`.

# 3. Multiply `c` by 2 using an assignment operator and print the new value of `c`.

# 4. Divide `c` by 4 using an assignment operator and print the new value of `c`.


# Exercise 5: Create Your Own Function
# Instructions: Write a Python function called `fizz_buzz` that takes an integer `n` as input.
# - If `n` is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
# - If `n` is divisible only by 3, print "Fizz"
# - If `n` is divisible only by 5, print "Buzz"
# - Otherwise, print the value of `n`.

# Test the function with different values of n
