# Homework Assignment: Control Flow and Loops - Questions Only

# Instructions:
# Complete the following exercises using if-else, elif statements, loops, and control flow in Python.

# Exercise 1: Number Comparison
# Write a Python program that takes three numbers as input and determines the largest of the three numbers.
# Example:
# Input: Enter three numbers: 10, 20, 5
# Output: 20 is the largest number.

# Exercise 2: Day of the Week

# Example:
# Input: Enter a number between 1 and 7: 3
# Output: Wednesday

# Exercise 3: Leap Year Checker
# Write a program that asks the user for a year and checks whether it is a leap year.
# Conditions for a leap year:
# - Divisible by 4.
# - If divisible by 100, it should also be divisible by 400.
# Example:
# Input: Enter a year: 2000
# Output: 2000 is a leap year.

# Exercise 4: Simple Calculator
# Create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations.
# Ask the user to input two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
# Use if-elif-else to perform the chosen operation and print the result.
# Example:
# Input: Enter first number: 12
# Input: Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
# Input: Enter second number: 4
# Output: 12 * 4 = 48

# Exercise 5: Voting Eligibility
# Write a program that asks the user for their age and checks whether they are eligible to vote.
# If they are under 18, print how many years are left until they can vote.
# Example:
# Input: Enter your age: 16
# Output: You can vote in 2 years.
